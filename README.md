# Bank-Note-Analysis
We will be using different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, Multilayer Perceptron to check whether a note is fake or not

# Description
In this project, we will classify a banknote as fake or genuine based on the given dataset from UCI machine learning repository which consists of about 1372 rows with 5 columns.

We will be using different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, Multilayer Perceptron

# Installation Packages and load library
Pyforest has been installed and import lazy_import library

# Load the dataset
BankNote_Authentication.csv is used for the project

# Visualization
Univariate and Bi-variable analysis has been done for Target variables and other features

# Model Building
The dataset has been split into training and testing data set based on 80% and 20% ratio

# Standard Scaler
* in the dataset, some of the vaues are potive and very high and some of the values are negative and low and few are zero. So we have to make all the values standardize using ((((StandardScaler or Zscores)))). The Zscores helps to rescale our data to have values between 0 & 1

# Different classification methods
### Logistic Regression and check the accuracies and confusion matrics using heatmap
### Support Vector Machine and check the accuracies and confusion matrics using heatmap
### RandomForecastClassifier and check the accuracies and confusion matrics using heatmap
### KNeighboursClassifier and check the accuracies and confusion matrics using heatmap

# Conclusion
Print all the models together to check which model is performing better so that we can suggest to the client.
